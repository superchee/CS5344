A community can be interpreted
as a union of smaller complete (fully connected) subgraphs that share nodes. A
k-clique is a fully connected subgraph consisting of k nodes. A k-clique
community can be defined as union of all k-cliques that can be reached from
each other through a series of adjacent k-cliques. Many researchers have used
cliques to detect overlapping communities

Paper: Finding statistically
significant communities in networks (OSLOM)



Code: http://www.oslom.org/



Requirement: N vertices, E
edges, degree of subgraph, internal and external degree of subgraph



Order Statistics Local Optimization Method(OSLOM): detects
clusters in networks, and can handle various kind of graph properties like edge
direction, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchy and network
dynamics. It is based on local optimization of a fitness function expressing
the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations,
which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics.

Paper: Detecting overlapping
communities in social networks by game theory and structural equivalence
concept. (game theory based)



Code: https://github.com/hamidalvari/D-GT



Requirement: V vertices and E
edges



This method proposed the
Dynamic Game Theory method (D-GT) which treated nodes as rational agents. These
agents perform actions in iterative and game theoretic manner so as to maximize
the total utility.



 



 



 



Newman and Girvan first defined a measure known as
‘modularity’ to judge the quality of partitions or communities formed20. The
modularity measure proposed by them has been widely accepted and used by researchers
to gauge the goodness of the modules obtained from the community detection
algorithms with high modularity corresponding to a better community structure.
Modularity was defined as Σ𝒆𝒊𝒊𝒊−𝒂𝒊𝟐
, where 𝒆𝒊𝒊 denotes fraction of the
edges that connect vertices in community 𝒊, 𝒆𝒊𝒋
denotes fraction of the edges connecting vertices in two different communities 𝒊
and 𝒋
while 𝒂𝒊=Σ𝒆𝒊𝒋𝒋
is the fraction of edges that connect to vertices in community 𝒊.
The value 𝑄=1 indicates a network with strong community
structure.
